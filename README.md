# Student Attendence Web App

This is a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) for tracking student attendance.

> ✨ **Made this for my dad** — he needed a clean, fast, and offline-friendly tool to manage classroom attendance, so I built this using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🚀 Features

* 📱 Installable as a mobile app (PWA)
* 📴 Works offline (caches data & UI)
* 💾 Data stored locally in your browser (no backend needed)
* 🧮 Simple, clean UI for easy attendance marking

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* HTML + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript
* Service Worker (for offline support)
* localStorage for saving data
* Hosted on GitHub Pages

## 🛠 How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser:

2. Click “Install” from the browser menu or install prompt.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

My father is a teacher and needed a lightweight app to take attendance without relying on Excel or bulky apps. So I built this — fast, simple, and offline-first.
